BNNP includes 4 files of "input.nn, scaling.data, weights.006.data, and weights.026.data"
DP includes only one file named FeC-frz-3.pb (please compress it before performing MD simulation)

Please be aware that the FeC-frz-3.pb was trained using DeepMD-kit-V2.2.3, wrong results might be given using V2.2.5-V2.2.7 if "compute atom/stress" was used in LAMMPS.
